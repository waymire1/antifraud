# antifraud

# STILL WORKING ON THIS. Will continue functionality and better looking for the user, soon.
# Why haven't I continued this yet? It's in alpha, and I need spreadsheets to adjust variables and looks, I also want to try to train the program.
# This is OpenSource and it's also MIT Licience. To that, I say, "If you want to improve it, have fun."
# What it will do later: This program is made for deeplearning fraud analysis on sales opperations. This should be used to determine fraud with a financial company actor, to determine paterns within your sales. Many weights are checked with this. The data should find trends that maybe the fiancial actor could not. And it will highlight trends. 
# And maybe I will rebuild it into a more formal business application, but this is a Python drawing pad version of the completed program.
